            <h2>PRIVACY POLICY FOR FLUMOJI</h2>

 <br/><br/>

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Flumoji ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by MIT Connection Science. The Application is  designed to help increase awareness of the spread of flu and flu-like symptoms and educate you on how to reduce the risk of -- and help prevent -- flu infection.  

 <br/><br/>
 

<h4>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h4>


 <br/>
 <span class="underline">User Provided Information </span>

 <br/><br/>
The Application obtains the information you provide when you download and install the Application. 

 <br/><br/>
 

When you use the Application, you generally provide (a) temporary facebook access to obtain username, profile picture, and friends list and (b) information you provide us when you contact us for help.

 <br/><br/>
 

We may also use the information you provided us to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

 <br/><br/>
<span class="underline">Automatically Collected Information </span>

 <br/><br/>
 

In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, the frequency of your mobile device use, and information about the way you use the Application.

 
 <br/><br/>

 

<h4>Does the Application collect precise real time information of the device?</h4>

 <br/>
 
Flumoji tracks a variety of real-time data from a user's phone in order to notice fluctuations in a user's activity levels, social levels, and general routine. These fluctuations are used to predict the spread of flu in users.
<br/>
<br/>
Components of real-time data the Application collects:

<ul>
    <li>Accelerometer</li>
    <li>WLAN</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Call Log/ SMS Log - The Application does not have access to phone numbers or the content of SMS messages</li>
    <li>Screen on/off state</li>
    <li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>

 

<h4>
Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h4>

 
 <br/>

No. We will not share your personal information with third parties. We will use your de-identified information in our research, but will never publish data that contains your identifiable information.

 

 

<h4>What are my opt-out rights?</h4>

 

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. You can also request to opt-out via email, at mitconnectionscience@gmail.com.


 <br/><br/>
<h4>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h4>

We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain
Automatically Collected information for up to 24 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate form. If you'd like us to delete 
User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact us at mitconnectionscience@gmail.com and we will
respond in a reasonable time. Please note that some or all of the User Provided Data may be required in order for the Application
to function properly.



 
 <br/><br/>

<h4>Children</h4>

 
Users are required to be 21 or older.
We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13 - or no one under 21 for that matter. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at mitconnectionscience@gmail.com. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.


  
 <br/><br/>

<h4>Security</h4>

 

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.




 
 <br/><br/>

<h4>Changes</h4>

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and informing you via email or text message. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
